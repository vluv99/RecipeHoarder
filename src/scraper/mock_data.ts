    "Prosciutto Pizza",
    "https://www.thespruceeats.com/prosciutto-pizza-4844358",
    "Ah, prosciutto pizza! The epic collision of two titanic Italian inventions explodes with spectacular umami flavor, balanced here by the dreamy, delicate flavor of burrata, and the peppery zip of bright green arugula. " +
    "Like most great Italian dishes, this pizza is all about quality ingredients and simple preparation. It's a dish of harmonious counterpoint. Less is more. Don't bog down your slice. Remember, Michelangelo's David emerged from a single block of marble. Keep the sauce and toppings light, and bake the pizza with only cheese and sauce, adding the prosciutto, arugula, and Parmesan afterward. Your prosciutto will stay silky and tender, and your arugula will hold its vibrant snap. Finish with some shaved Parmesan (better yet, real Parmigiano-Reggiano), a dash of the best olive oil you can afford, and your masterpiece will be complete.",
